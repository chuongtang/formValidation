A form validation with some JavaScript.
The goal of this project is to show one way to validate the data input into each field using RegEx. 
The field border will be red if data type is not match and turn green if matching is detected.


Great free resources that I used:
fotello.com
google font


New cool things that I learned:

css: letter-spacing: is great for titles and labels

:value pseudo class for input

Built-in form validation uses HTML5

password validation on regexr.com
